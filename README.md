# arocketmanbot
Reddit bot that retrieves informations from /r/videos' youtube videos and makes up a comment.

JReddit is being used to connect to reddit's API. Jsoup to retrieve information from the youtube page.

##### The bot consists of three main classes:

* Bot class - Takes care of all of the Connection to the Bot and posting.
* YoutubeVideo class - Retrieves information about the Youtube videos posted through JSoup. I might change this to youtube's API.
* Main class - Starts the bot.

Pull requests are WELCOME! I made this bot on livecoding.tv live. You can check it out on my channel.
